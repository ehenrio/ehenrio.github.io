title: product backlog

goal is to build a _nice_ site :)

~~ post -> markdown ~~
----------------------
so that I can write text

~~ slug ~~
----------
so that url is representative of post content

~~ link ~~
----------
well, it's html

what to do with the date ?
--------------------------
at least document usage :)

current is

* order on filesystem
* reversed order on site

work on style
-------------

usemin and the like?
--------------------
so that browser makes less requests
found it, looks like https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-useref makes it wonderfully

and it is not in https://github.com/gulpjs/plugins/blob/master/src/blackList.json
