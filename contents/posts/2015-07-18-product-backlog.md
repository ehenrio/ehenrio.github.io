goal is to build a _nice_ site :)

1- post -> markdown
-------------------
so that I can write text

2- slug
-------
so that url is representative of post content

3- link
-------
well, it's html

4- what to do with the date ?
-----------------------------
at least document usage :)

current is

* order on filesystem
* reversed order on site
